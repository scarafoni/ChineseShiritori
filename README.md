Git 101 (for the new guys)
==========================
        1. there is a central repository  (on github.com) and many local ones, which are on your computer
        2. git allows everyone to work on the code simultaneously
        3. you makes changes to the repo in commits, basically tracked changes with a message about what you changed, 
           -make changes -> commit them -> get other changes from repo -> repeat
        4. useful commands (git is a commandline program, so use it from the commandline)
        5. 'git clone <url>' sets up the github repository on your machine (the url is from the github repo)
        6. 'git pull' gets you the latest version of the code from the repo online (after you've cloned it I mean)
        7. 'git add <file>' adds the file to the git repo. If you just make a new file in your repo it is NOT automatically added
        8. 'git commit -am "<message>"' save all changes in a commit, and <message> is a message telling what you changed
        9. 'git push' actually send all changes (commits) to the server
